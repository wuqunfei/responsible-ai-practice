# AI Transparency in Pet Insurance Claims
## Making Black-Box Decisions Explainable & Trustworthy

---

## 🚨 **The Problem**

### **Current State: AI Black Box**
- **80%** of pet insurance claims processed by AI
- **0%** explainability of decisions
- **$2.3M** in disputed claims annually
- **3 regulatory warnings** in past year

### **Pain Points**
> "Why was my emergency surgery claim rejected while my neighbor's routine checkup was approved?" - Customer

- ❌ **Customer Trust**: 47% satisfaction rate due to unexplained rejections
- ❌ **Regulatory Risk**: New regulations require AI decision transparency
- ❌ **Operational Chaos**: Staff spend 6 hours/day investigating AI decisions
- ❌ **Lost Revenue**: 23% customer churn from "unfair" decisions

---

## 💡 **The Solution**

### **SHAP-Powered Decision Intelligence**

**Before**: "Claim Rejected" ❌

**After**: "Claim Rejected because: preventive care (weight: -0.8), no medical emergency (weight: -0.6), routine procedure (weight: -0.5)" ✅

### **How It Works** (Simple!)
1. **AI Processes Claim** → Normal GPT evaluation
2. **SHAP Explains Why** → Identifies key decision factors  
3. **Business Rules Generated** → Creates understandable guidelines
4. **Customer Gets Clarity** → Full transparency provided

### **Real Example**
```
Claim: "Emergency surgery for dog who ate chocolate. $4,000 bill."

Explanation Generated:
✅ APPROVED - Emergency medical condition (85% weight)
Key Factors: • "emergency" (+high impact)
             • "surgery" (+high impact)  
             • Cost within emergency limits
```
